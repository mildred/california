/**
 * A reference-counted source ID to better control execution of Idle and Timeout callbacks in the
 * event loop.
 *
 * Idle and Timeout provide "fire and forget" ways to schedule events to be executed later.
 * Cancelling those calls after scheduling them is easy to get wrong, since the returned uint (the
 * source ID) is invalid once the callback has been removed from the scheduler, which must be done
 * manually by the calling code.
 *
 * Scheduled manages the validity of the source ID.  It also simplifies writing delegates for the
 * callback (especially for the Idle case) to make it easier to write Vala anonoymous functions.
 *
 * Note that if the last reference to a Scheduled is dropped the callback will be cancelled if its
 * not already executed and continuous callbacks will halt.
